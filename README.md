Install Qt Creator
Welcome to CS106B! This assignment is designed to help you get your development environment set up so that you can compile, run, and debug programs. There isn’t any programming involved, and we hope that this doesn’t take you too much time to complete. This assignment must be completed individually.

Step One: Install Qt Creator

You will frst need to install Qt Creator, the development environment that we use in CS106B. Follow the instructions in the Qt Installation Guide for your operating system.

If you run into an install snag, don’t panic! The course staf will hold a Qt Creator install help session 2PM – 4PM PT on Thursday, January 6th over Zoom. See Ed for the link. You can also ask for help with a post to the Ed forum.

Step Two: Download the Starter Files

We will confgure a starter project with the fles needed for each assignment and post it in the form of a .zip archive. The starter project for Assignment 0 contains the fles for the NameHash program.
